# Automated_Electrode_Coordinate_Extraction

1. Use the scripts in the `electrode_extraction_by_hand` directory to extract the electrode positions. For every electrode six positions on the rim of the electrode is needed to compute the electrode centre.
2. `cylinder_roi` includes scripts that are used to create a cylindrical region of interest (ROI) around the electrode, using the electrode centre as origin. This script also computes the electrode centre and writes it into a file for further use.
